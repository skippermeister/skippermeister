- 👋 Hi, I’m @skippermeister
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT development and house automation like solar power. I am familar with hardware development digital and some analog technologies. I develope with C and C++, some Java and have little knowledge of web design via VUE. In addition I coded some modules for iobroker (Java and node-red). I developed several ESP8266, ESP32 and Arduino IoT devices like controller for the valves of underfloor heating, controller for a Grundfoss hot water circulation pump or SmartMeters with SML interface for electricity meters and district heating meters. I'am using iobroker on a raspi and developed several software modules for my house automation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deeper understanding of using VUE to design web frontends.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IoT projects like OpenDTU, OpenDTU onBattery, tasmota, ESPhome.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
